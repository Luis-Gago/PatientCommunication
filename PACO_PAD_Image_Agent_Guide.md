### Difference between normal artery and atherosclerosis in artery
**Source:** NIH  
**Description:** Atherosclerosis in the leg arteries. The image shows how PAD affects the arteries in the legs. Figure A shows a normal artery with normal blood flow. The inset image shows a cross section of the normal artery. Figure B shows an artery with plaque buildup that is partially blocking blood flow. The inset image shows a cross section of the narrowed artery.

### Ankle brachial index (ABI)
**Source:** NIH  
**Description:** The ankle-brachial index (ABI) test is usually the first test used to diagnose PAD. The test compares blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm. Your provider uses a blood pressure cuff and  ultrasound  device for this painless test. A healthy ABI result is 1.00 or greater. If you have an ABI of less than 0.90 while resting, you may have PAD. An ABI of less than 0.40 is a sign of severe PAD.

### Circulation system
**Source:** Created with biorender  
**Description:** The heart pumps blood into blood vessels called arteries. Arteries deliver blood throughout the body. Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart.

### What is PAD
**Source:** Created with biorender  
**Description:** Peripheral artery disease, or PAD, is caused by atherosclerosis. This causes plaque buildup in the walls of blood vessels called arteries. The plaque can reduce or block blood flow to the tissues.

### Difference between artery and vein
**Source:** Created with biorender  
**Description:** Arteries are blood vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the tissues. Veins are blood vessels that return oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.

### Medications for PAD
**Source:** Created with biorender  
**Description:** If you have PAD, your provider may prescribe medications such as aspirin, other anti-platelet drugs like Plavix (or clopidogrel), blood thinners like Xarelto (or rivaroxaban), statins, and Pletal (or cilostazol).

### Stages of PAD
**Source:** Created with biorender  
**Description:** PAD can take different forms. You may have reduced or absent pulses in the feet. You may have claudication, which is leg pain, soreness, or tiredness when you walk that resolves with rest. You can have rest pain, which is pain in the feet that occurs when you are not walking. It can wake up from sleep at night. You might also notice sores on your feet that heal slowly or do not heal. Gangrene is caused by tissue death when the lack of blood flow is severe.

```

### Complications of PAD
**Source:** Created with biorender  
**Description:** PAD leads to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. PAD also causes pain, soreness, tiredness, and weakness in the legs, which makes it hard to walk. PAD can also cause foot sores that do not heal or get infected, which can lead to a leg amputation.

### Risk factors for PAD
**Source:** Created with chatgpt  
**Description:** Risk factors for PAD include smoking cigarettes or cigars, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, increasing age, and lack of physical exercise

### Tests that can be used to diagnose PAD
**Source:** Created with chatgpt  
**Description:** PAD can be diagnosed in several different ways. Your doctor can perform or order an ankle-brachal index, or ABI, which compares the blood pressure between your arms and your ankles. This can be done while you are exercising on a treadmill. Sometimes ABI is also done with a Doppler test of your entire leg. A CT or MR angiogram shows the pattern of problems in your blood vessels.

### How to manage foot sores and ulcers caused by PAD
**Source:** Created with chatgpt  
**Description:** If you have foot sores or ulcers caused by PAD, it is important to keep them clean and dry and covered with a clean dressing. See your vascular surgeon, podiatrist, or wound care doctor for more specific instructions.

```

### How smoking affects PAD
**Source:** Created with chatgpt  
**Description:** Smoking damages arteries and increases the buildup of plaque in the wall. It also causes blood vessels to narrow, which reduces blood flow further. Smoking also makes blood more prone to clotting.

```

### Healthy lifestyle habits for PAD
**Source:** Created with chatgpt  
**Description:** If you have PAD, it is important to exercise regularly. Walking is recommended therapy for PAD. Eat a healthy diet which is balanced in nutrients, low in fat, low in salt, and high in fiber. Lean proteins are good. Do not smoke or get help to quit smoking. Take your medications as prescribed and follow your medical provider's instructions.

```

### Stenting of a leg artery
**Source:** Created with chatgpt  
**Description:** If your doctor recommends a stenting procedure for PAD, it means that a metal frame, or stent, will be placed inside an area of narrowing in the blood vessel to improve blood flow. Sometimes the stent is stretched open by a balloon on a catheter, which is removed once the stent is in place.

```

### Pain in legs when walking 
**Source:** Created with chatgpt  
**Description:** PAD can cause your legs to feel tired, sore, painful, or weak when you walk. This is caused by reduced blood flow to the muscles in your legs.

## Usage Example

When explaining PAD diagnosis, integrate an image link naturally:

> The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the first-line diagnostic test for PAD. It compares blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm. A result below 0.90 suggests PAD. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrDavidL/pad/main/images/ankle-brachial%20index%20test_1%20from%20NIH.jpg" target="_blank">View: Ankle brachial index (ABI)</a>
